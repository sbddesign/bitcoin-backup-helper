# Bitcoin Backup Helper

Bitcoin Backup Helper is a project of the [Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design/).

The goal of this project is to help make bitcoin more usable by creating a tool that assists people with backing up
their Bitcoin wallets.

This tool leads the user through a series of questions around their wallet. Based on the answers, it will generate a
template which the user can print out and write their wallet information on.

Initially created for the MIT Bitcoin Expo Hackacthon 2021.

## Open Design

The Backup Helper is designed in Figma. Here is the most current design file.
